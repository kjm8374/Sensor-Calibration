A data.txt was created by passing the output of the realDevice file to diffVal
which created x and y values of ideal values and error (real - ideal) values
which were then passed into hw11.c file to create a correction polynomial. The
hw11.c file was programed to read the data.txt file and create matrices to
solve over determined system of equations. A matrix was populated by x values
and b vector was populated by y values. The matrix Ax = b was solved using 
normal equations to find the least squares solution. Then these values were
were used to create a correction polynomial. Since the polynomial was created
using real values, the correction.c file takes in ideal values and the real
values and the real values are passed into the polynomial to get the error
and then the real values are subtracted by the error to model the ideal values.
Then the data from the realDevices and the correction file is pasted together
to alldata.txt which contain ideal data, real data and improved data. Then 
this alldata is passed into myplot to plot the graph.
